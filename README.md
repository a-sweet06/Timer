# WorkTimed

Allison Sweet

The goal of my app is to help students of any age to stay on task while studying and completing homework. It will feature multiple modes so they can choose how they would like to study. The app will also feature a calandar to create a study schedule. Modes include the app setting a timer for you with separate break timers throughout, the user inputting the time they have to study and the app breaking it down for them, and a more free mode that tracks how long the user has been working and how many breaks they have taken.

The way it will be structured is by first asking the user to pick a mode and set the timer based on their input. It will also give the user encouragments and will give them the option to pause and switch modes.
